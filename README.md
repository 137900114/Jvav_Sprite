# Jvav_Sprite
write in jvav , run every where!

The jvav sprite is not a real program language that exist in real life(I'm trying to make it a real language).

Jvav,Jvav Sprite and Ojbkle has nothing to do with Java ,Java Script and Oracle in real life.

I have no intention to insult anyone(That's why I don't show ZHY's full name).Some internet meme is the reason why I create this language(I
have to admit that ZHY really has a funny face)
